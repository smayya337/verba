# Verba: Latin Word Analysis and Translation to English

This project aims to translate Latin words to English.

It's inspired by `WORDS`, by Col. William Whitaker (1936-2010), and much of the data used in this program is taken from `WORDS` version 1.97E.
Currently, `verba` can take an input of a single word or multiple words and retrieve all matching Latin words.
